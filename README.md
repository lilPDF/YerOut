###Play as a baseball umpire were your only two options are to call it as you see it!##


###It was a dozy to create a sport's sim over the last week, but one of my first jobs was an umpire.###

Good luck finishing this game in it's alpha state. want to rework it over the year into a VR Game.


I still want to add a few more things like: 
```
-Team Names and Jersey colors

-Hitting the ball and having the bases get fille
-Walking the batter and having them walked when the ball hits the batter
-Mini-game to call safe or out on hit's, steals
-home plate slide positing
-VR hand signals and voice calls
```
